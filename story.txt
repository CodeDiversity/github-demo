Once upon a time in a faraway land,
there lived a brave knight named Sir Lancelot.

One day, an unexpected visitor arrived at the kingdom, challenging Sir Lancelot to a duel.
It turned out to be his long-lost brother, Sir Gawain.

Sir Lancelot was known for his bravery and chivalry.
He had a loyal companion, a white steed named Snowflake.
Together, they had faced countless adventures and saved the kingdom from peril.
